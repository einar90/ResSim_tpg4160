\section{Data and plots} % (fold)
\label{sec:data_and_plots}

All plots are shown in in the following pages. Only plots showing \emph{both} lines for DRSDT=0 and the default DRSDT setting are shown.

The DATA file was modified to include the gas-oil ratio and BHP for the injection well by inserting the following lines in the summary section:
\begin{verbatim}
-- WELL GAS-OIL RATIO FOR INJECTOR
WGOR
'INJECTOR'
/
-- WELL BOTTOM-HOLE PRESSURE
WBHP
'INJECTOR'
/
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This is why I've named the plotted data ``...\_mod''. The lines labeled ``...\_mod\_6'' are the lines from assignment 6, i.e. with DRSDT defaulted. These are in all cases the red lines. Views of water, oil and gas saturation in the uppermost block layer ($z=1$) are shown on the last three pages.

\section{DRSDT: Maximum rate of increase of solution GOR} % (fold)
\label{sec:drsdt_maximum_rate_of_increase_of_solution_gor}

% section drsdt_maximum_rate_of_increase_of_solution_gor (end)
When DRSDT is set to 0, which it initially is in the file and thus on the black lines in the plots, the solution GOR is not allowed to rise; i.e. none of the injected (or reservoir) gas is dissolved into the reservoir oil, even if it is undersaturated. When it is defaulted the re-solution rate is unrestricted (equivalent to DRSDT=inf), and $R_s$ will rise very quickly until there is either no free gas left or the oil is saturated.

We see in the WGOR plot that towards the end the gas-oil ratio approaches 1. This is because when the gas is not ``allowed'' to dissolve, it will first force out the oil, leaving only the gas to be produced at the end.

We see in the FOPR plot that oil production drops after some time when DRSDT=0, but remains constant when it is infinite. This is because when DSRDT=inf, the gas dissolved in the oil and is produced
